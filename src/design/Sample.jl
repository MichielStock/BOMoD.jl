Using the default settings, It fills `x` with unique samples from the `Eff_Space`. It returns a vector with the corresponding samples.
If with_index = true, corresponding indexes returned together with the sampled constructs.

Return Array with dimension (n x 2).  The function samples `n` constructs from the input `space`, these are stored in the first collum.
The second column returns the corresponding indices of the construct in the closest efficient design space.
These are not the correct indexes in the constrained space.
Currently not sure if returning them is useful. The with_index = true is to be similar to the other sampler, has no influence on the output

The sampling is based on a recursive function with a reject the unwanted constructs.
These are the constructs which are not allowed based on the given constraints.
For design space with many constraints, it is not efficient, and explicit calculation of the design space may be a better alternative using
